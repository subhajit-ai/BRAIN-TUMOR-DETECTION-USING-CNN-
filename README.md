This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain MRI images into categories related to brain tumors. Using deep learning techniques, the model learns spatial features directly from images and achieves high classification accuracy. The workflow includes:

Preprocessing MRI image data.

Building and training a CNN architecture.

Evaluating model performance on test data.

Visualizing training progress and predictions.

The goal is to assist in medical image analysis by providing an automated, accurate, and efficient way of detecting brain tumors, supporting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making.
